## 🟡 **Found the Issue! Missing Environment Variables**

Perfect! The backend is responding, but I can see the problem:

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "api": "healthy", 
  "parallel_hybrid": "unavailable"  ← This is the problem
}
```

**Diagnosis:** The basic API is working, but the **Advanced Parallel Hybrid system is unavailable** because it's missing the required API keys and database credentials.

---

## 🔧 **Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variables**

The parallel hybrid system needs these credentials to work:

### **Go to mrca-backend Service:**
1. **Click on "mrca-backend"** in your dashboard
2. **Find and click the "Environment" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY = your-actual-gemini-api-key-here
NEO4J_URI = neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_PASSWORD = your-neo4j-password
```

### **How to Add Environment Variables:**
1. **Look for "Add Environment Variable" button**
2. **Enter each key-value pair**
3. **Make sure to use exact variable names** (case-sensitive)
4. **Save the changes**

---

## 📋 **Step 2: Restart the Service**

After adding the environment variables:
1. **The service should restart automatically**
2. **Or look for "Deploy Latest Commit" or "Restart" button**
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the restart to complete

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Verify the Fix**

After the service restarts, **test the health endpoint again:**
```
https://mrca-backend.onrender.com/health
```

### **Expected Fixed Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T...",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "components": {
    "api": "healthy",
    "parallel_hybrid": "healthy"  ← Should now be healthy
  }
}
```

---

## 🎯 **Step 4: Test Your Frontend**

Once the backend shows "healthy", go back to your frontend:
```
https://mrca-frontend.onrender.com
```

**The system status should now show:**
- **Parallel Hybrid: 🟢 Healthy**

**Then test with a query like:**
- "What are methane monitoring requirements?"

---

## 🔑 **Required Credentials Reminder**

You'll need:
1. **OpenAI API Key** (starts with `sk-`)
2. **Google Gemini API Key** 
3. **Neo4j Aura URI** (starts with `neo4j+s://`)
4. **Neo4j Aura Password**

**Can you add these environment variables to your mrca-backend service?** Once you do that, the Advanced Parallel Hybrid system should come online and your frontend will be able to connect! 🚀 

## ✅ **NEO4J_USERNAME in render.yaml**

In the `render.yaml` file, it's already configured:

```yaml
envVars:
  # ... other variables ...
  - key: NEO4J_URI
    sync: false
  - key: NEO4J_USERNAME
    value: "neo4j"  # ← This is already set!
  - key: NEO4J_PASSWORD
    sync: false
```

## 🔍 **Check Your Render Dashboard**

However, you need to verify this is properly configured in your **Render Environment** tab. Here's what to check:

### **Go to mrca-backend Environment Tab:**

1. **Click on "mrca-backend"** in your dashboard
2. **Find the "Environment" tab**
3. **Look for these Neo4j variables:**

**✅ Should be configured:**
```
```

## 🔧 **If NEO4J_USERNAME is Missing, Add It:**

**In the Environment tab:**
1. **Click "Add Environment Variable"**
2. **Name:** `NEO4J_USERNAME`
3. **Value:** `neo4j`
4. **Click "Save"**

## 🎯 **Complete Neo4j Environment Variables Checklist:**

Make sure you have **all three** Neo4j variables:

```
✅ NEO4J_URI = neo4j+s://your-actual-instance.databases.neo4j.io
✅ NEO4J_USERNAME = neo4j
✅ NEO4J_PASSWORD = your-actual-neo4j-password
```

## 🔄 **After Adding Missing Variables:**

1. **Save the environment variables**
2. **Trigger a new deployment** (or it may auto-deploy)
3. **Test the backend health:**
   ```
   https://mrca-backend.onrender.com/health
   ```

The response should change from `"parallel_hybrid": "unavailable"` to showing proper confidence scores when all credentials are configured correctly.

**Let me know what you see in your Environment tab - are all three Neo4j variables present?** 

## 🎯 **Found the Issue!**

Looking at your Dockerfile, I can see the problem. The **PYTHONPATH should be `/`** not `/app`.

## 📁 **Current Container Structure**

From your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY ../backend .                # Copies backend contents to /app
COPY ../.streamlit ../.streamlit/  # Copies to /.streamlit
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app             # ← This is WRONG
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", ...]
```

This creates:
```
/
  .streamlit/           # Secrets location
  app/                  # Working directory
    main.py
    config.py
    parallel_hybrid.py
    tools/
    ...
```

## ⚠️ **The Problem**

Your code likely has imports like:
```python
from backend.config import get_config
from backend.tools.vector import search_regulations
```

But with `PYTHONPATH=/app`, Python can't find the `backend` package because it doesn't exist at that level.

## ✅ **The Fix**

**Change PYTHONPATH from `/app` to `/`:**

### **In your Render Environment tab:**
1. **Edit the PYTHONPATH variable**
2. **Change from:** `/app`  
3. **Change to:** `/`
4. **Save and redeploy**

## 🔧 **Alternative: Check Your Import Structure**

Or verify what imports your code actually uses:
```
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/ .                # Copies backend contents to /app
COPY .streamlit/ ../.streamlit/  # Copies to /.streamlit
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app             # ← This is WRONG
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", ...]
``` 

## 🔍 **Confirmed: PYTHONPATH Should Be `/`**

The grep results show your code uses imports like:
```python
from backend.config import get_config
from backend.tools.vector import test_vector_search
from backend.circuit_breaker import get_circuit_breaker
```

This confirms that **PYTHONPATH should be `/`** not `/app`.

## 🔄 **Quick Fix Steps:**

### **1. Update Environment Variable in Render:**
```
PYTHONPATH = /
```
(Change from `/app` to `/`)

### **2. Also Update the Dockerfile (Optional but Recommended):**
