**🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns**

**Service Orchestration Architecture**
```python
# Two-service launch sequence with dependency management
class DevContainerLauncher:
    def launch(self):
        # Phase 1: Process Cleanup (eliminate conflicts)
        self.cleanup_processes()
        
        # Phase 2: Backend Service Launch (API foundation)
        self.start_backend()
        time.sleep(2)  # Inter-service startup delay
        
        # Phase 3: Frontend Service Launch (UI layer)
        self.start_frontend()
        
        # Phase 4: Health Validation (service readiness)
        self.wait_for_services()
        
        # Phase 5: Information Display (user guidance)
        self.print_access_info()
        
        # Phase 6: Continuous Monitoring (service lifecycle)
        while True: time.sleep(10)  # Keep launcher active
```

**🎛️ DevContainerLauncher Class Architecture**

**Class Definition & Initialization**
```python
class DevContainerLauncher:
    """Comprehensive launcher for MRCA services in Dev Container environments.

    This class orchestrates the startup, monitoring, and shutdown of both frontend
    and backend services for the MRCA Advanced Parallel Hybrid application.
    """
    
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initializes the DevContainerLauncher with default state."""
        self.backend_process = None      # Process handle for FastAPI backend
        self.frontend_process = None     # Process handle for Streamlit frontend
        self.project_root = Path(__file__).parent.absolute()  # Project root resolution
```

**Instance Architecture**:
- **Process Management**: Subprocess handles for both services with proper lifecycle tracking
- **Path Resolution**: Automatic project root detection for relative path operations
- **State Tracking**: Service state management with process handle preservation
- **Resource Control**: Memory and process resource allocation and cleanup

**Class Design Benefits**:
- **Encapsulation**: Self-contained launcher logic with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Proper instance state tracking for multi-service coordination
- **Resource Safety**: Process handle management prevents orphaned processes
- **Path Abstraction**: Environment-independent path resolution for containerized deployment

---

**🧹 Process Management & Cleanup Architecture**

**Comprehensive Process Cleanup**
```python
def cleanup_processes(self) -> None:
    """Terminates any existing MRCA service processes.

    Performs a comprehensive cleanup of any running Streamlit or Uvicorn processes
    that might conflict with the new service instances.
    """
    print("Cleaning up existing processes...")
    try:
        # Kill any existing Streamlit processes (frontend conflicts)
        subprocess.run(["pkill", "-f", "streamlit"], check=False, capture_output=True)
        
        # Kill any existing Uvicorn processes (backend conflicts)  
        subprocess.run(["pkill", "-f", "uvicorn"], check=False, capture_output=True)
        
        time.sleep(2)  # Process termination grace period
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Note: {e}")  # Non-critical error handling
    print("✅ Process cleanup complete")
```

**Process Cleanup Architecture**:

**1. Conflict Prevention Strategy**:
```python
# Target process patterns for comprehensive cleanup
pkill_targets = [
    "streamlit",  # Streamlit web server processes (port 8501 conflicts)
    "uvicorn"     # FastAPI/Uvicorn server processes (port 8000 conflicts)
]
```

**Process Cleanup Benefits**:
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Eliminates existing processes occupying required ports (8000, 8501)
- **Clean Slate Startup**: Ensures no residual processes interfere with new service instances
- **Development Iteration**: Supports rapid development cycles with repeated launcher execution
- **Resource Liberation**: Frees memory and system resources from previous service instances

**2. Signal-Based Process Termination**:
```python
subprocess.run(["pkill", "-f", "process_pattern"], check=False, capture_output=True)
```

**Termination Strategy Features**:
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses process command line pattern matching for precise targeting
- **Non-Blocking Execution**: `check=False` prevents exceptions from stopping cleanup process
- **Output Suppression**: `capture_output=True` prevents noise from termination operations
- **Grace Period**: 2-second delay allows processes to terminate completely before proceeding

**3. Error Resilience**:
```python
try:
    # Process cleanup operations
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Note: {e}")  # Informative but non-critical error handling
```

**Error Handling Benefits**:
- **Non-Critical Failure**: Cleanup failures don't prevent launcher startup progression
- **User Awareness**: Informative error messages without alarming presentation
- **Robust Startup**: Launcher continues even if cleanup encounters issues
- **Development Friendly**: Handles cases where target processes don't exist

    """Launches the FastAPI backend server with proper configuration.

    Starts the Uvicorn ASGI server hosting the MRCA backend API with reload
    capability and proper host binding for container environments.
    """
    print("Starting backend server...")
    
    backend_cmd = [
        sys.executable, "-m", "uvicorn",  # Python module execution
        "backend.main:app",               # FastAPI application specification
        "--host", "0.0.0.0",             # Container-friendly host binding
        "--port", str(BACKEND_PORT),     # Configurable port (default 8000)
        "--reload",                      # Development hot-reload capability
        "--timeout-keep-alive", "3600",  # 1-hour keep-alive for persistent sessions
        "--timeout-graceful-shutdown", "30",  # Graceful shutdown timeout
        "--access-log"                   # Enable access logging
    ]
    
    self.backend_process = subprocess.Popen(
        backend_cmd,
        cwd=self.project_root,           # Execute from project root
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,          # Capture stdout for monitoring
        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,        # Merge stderr into stdout
        text=True                        # Text mode for string output
    )
    
    print(f"✅ Backend server starting on http://0.0.0.0:{BACKEND_PORT}")
    return True
```

    - ./frontend:/app                          # Live UI development
  environment:
    - MRCA_DEBUG=true                         # Debug mode enabled
    - MRCA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG                    # Verbose logging
  restart: "no"                              # Development: manual restart

# Production mode configuration (reference)
production_mode:
  # volumes: []                              # No volume mounts in production
  environment:
    - MRCA_DEBUG=false                        # Debug mode disabled
    - MRCA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                     # Production logging
  restart: unless-stopped                     # Automatic restart
```
