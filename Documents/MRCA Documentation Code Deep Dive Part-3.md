- **`curl`**: HTTP client tool essential for health checks, API testing, and container orchestration integration
- **Cleanup Strategy**: `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` removes package cache to minimize final image size

---

**🐍 Python Dependencies & Environment Optimization**

**Optimized Dependency Installation**
```dockerfile
# Copy requirements file first for better Docker layer caching
COPY backend/requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies with pip optimization
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependency Management Architecture**:

**1. Layer Caching Optimization**:
```dockerfile
# Strategic file copying for maximum cache efficiency
COPY backend/requirements.txt .     # Dependencies first (changes less frequently)
# ... dependency installation ...
COPY backend/ .                     # Source code last (changes more frequently)
```

**Cache Strategy Benefits**:
- **Development Efficiency**: Source code changes don't invalidate dependency layer cache
- **Build Performance**: Dependency installation layer cached across builds (saves 2-5 minutes per build)
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Faster pipeline execution with intelligent layer reuse
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced bandwidth and storage requirements for repeated builds

**2. Production-Optimized Pip Configuration**:

except Exception as e:
    health_status["components"]["neo4j_connection"] = "error"
    health_status["errors"].append(f"Neo4j connection: {str(e)}")
```

**2. Vector Index Status Assessment**:
```python
# Test vector index by counting nodes
query = "MATCH (n:Chunk) RETURN count(n) as chunk_count"
result = graph.query(query)
chunk_count = result[0]["chunk_count"] if result else 0

health_status["components"]["vector_index"] = "healthy" if chunk_count > 0 else "empty"
health_status["metrics"]["index_node_count"] = chunk_count
```

**3. Embeddings Functionality Testing**:
```python
embeddings = get_embeddings()
test_embedding = embeddings.embed_query("test query")
health_status["components"]["embeddings"] = "healthy" if len(test_embedding) > 0 else "error"
```

```python
retriever = get_vector_retriever()
test_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("safety equipment", k=1)
health_status["components"]["retrieval"] = "healthy" if len(test_docs) > 0 else "no_results"
```

**Health Status Aggregation**:
```python
# Determine overall status based on component health
component_statuses = list(health_status["components"].values())
if all(status == "healthy" for status in component_statuses):
    health_status["status"] = "healthy"
elif any(status == "healthy" for status in component_statuses):
    health_status["status"] = "degraded"
else:
    health_status["status"] = "error"
```

        if health["status"] in ["healthy", "degraded"]:
            return search_regulations_semantic  # Full functionality
        else:
            logger.warning(f"Vector tool unhealthy: {health['errors']}")
            return _vector_fallback  # Fallback function
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Vector tool initialization failed: {str(e)}")
        return _vector_fallback  # Error recovery
```

**Comprehensive Fallback Function**
```python
def _vector_fallback(question: str) -> str:
    """Informative fallback when VectorRAG unavailable."""

    # Test document creation with mining regulatory content
    test_doc = Document(
        page_content="Mine safety requires proper ventilation systems in underground coal mines.",
        metadata={'source': 'test', 'chunk_num': 1}
    )
    
    # LLM transformer validation with entity extraction
    graph_documents = self.llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents([test_doc])
    
    # Validation reporting with detailed metrics
    for graph_doc in graph_documents:
        print(f"📊 Graph doc: {len(graph_doc.nodes)} nodes, {len(graph_doc.relationships)} relationships")
```

                        "USES", "LOCATED_IN", "GOVERNS", "APPLIES_TO", "CONTAINS", "SPECIFIES"]

# LLM transformer with controlled type constraints
self.llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=self.llm,
    allowed_nodes=allowed_nodes,
    allowed_relationships=allowed_relationships,
    strict_mode=False  # Flexible mode for development testing
)
